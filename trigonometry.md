# Basic Trigonometry
## Understanding Triangles and Ratios

# What is Trigonometry?

**Trigonometry** is the study of relationships between:
- Angles
- Side lengths of triangles

The word comes from Greek:
- *trigonon* = triangle
- *metron* = measure

# The Right Triangle

```
        C
        |\ 
        | \  hypotenuse
        |  \
opposite|   \
        |    \
        |     \
        |______\
        A  adjacent  B
```

Key components:
- **Hypotenuse**: longest side (opposite the right angle)
- **Opposite**: side opposite to the angle of interest
- **Adjacent**: side next to the angle of interest

---

# The Three Basic Ratios

For angle θ (theta) in a right triangle:

**SOH-CAH-TOA**

- **sin θ = Opposite / Hypotenuse**
- **cos θ = Adjacent / Hypotenuse**  
- **tan θ = Opposite / Adjacent**

This mnemonic helps you remember!

# Example: Finding sin, cos, tan

```
        C
        |\ 
      5 | \ 13
        |  \
        |___\
        A  12  B
```

For angle B:
- sin B = 5/13 = 0.385
- cos B = 12/13 = 0.923
- tan B = 5/12 = 0.417


# Finding Missing Sides

**Given**: angle and one side  
**Find**: other sides

**Example**: If angle A = 30° and hypotenuse = 10
- opposite = 10 × sin 30° = 10 × 0.5 = 5
- adjacent = 10 × cos 30° = 10 × 0.866 = 8.66

Use the appropriate ratio based on what you know!

# Finding Missing Angles

**Given**: two sides  
**Find**: angle

Use inverse functions:
- θ = sin⁻¹(opposite/hypotenuse)
- θ = cos⁻¹(adjacent/hypotenuse)
- θ = tan⁻¹(opposite/adjacent)

**Example**: If opposite = 3, adjacent = 4
- θ = tan⁻¹(3/4) = 36.87°

---

# The Pythagorean Theorem

In any right triangle:

**a² + b² = c²**

where c is the hypotenuse

**Example**: If legs are 3 and 4:
- 3² + 4² = c²
- 9 + 16 = c²
- c = √25 = 5

# Real-World Applications

Trigonometry is used in:
- **Game Dev**: calculating roof slopes
- **Graphics**: finding distances and bearings
- **Art**: analyzing forces and motion
- **Design**: designing structures
- **Architecture**: measuring distances to stars

# Practice Problem

A ladder leans against a wall at a 70° angle with the ground. The ladder is 15 feet long.

**Questions**:
1. How high up the wall does it reach?
2. How far is the base from the wall?

**Answers**:
1. height = 15 × sin 70° = 14.1 feet
2. distance = 15 × cos 70° = 5.1 feet

---

# Summary

**Remember SOH-CAH-TOA**:
- Sin = Opposite/Hypotenuse
- Cos = Adjacent/Hypotenuse
- Tan = Opposite/Adjacent

**Key Tools**:
- Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²
- Inverse functions for finding angles
- Special triangles: 30-60-90 and 45-45-90
